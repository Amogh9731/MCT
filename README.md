The homepage of the website was fairly easy to create, and I didnâ€™t encounter many issues. However, I did face some difficulty in adding the favicon and images when the website first loaded. After some research and troubleshooting, I was able to resolve the issue by correctly linking the favicon in the HTML head section and ensuring the image paths were properly set.

The second page of the website, which is the music section, was relatively easy to build. However, I faced challenges with the favicon-like play, pause, and replay buttons, as well as the music controller. I overcame these issues by leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, conducting thorough research, revisiting previous class sessions, referring to the MDN documentation, and reviewing my past assignments.

In the third section, which focuses on scene, I encountered challenges with adding timestamps to the audio and creating the rotate and hide arrow functions. However, I was able to resolve these issues through research and by implementing solutions using JavaScript.

In the fourth section, Relax and Breathe, I encountered difficulties in designing the rotating ball along with the covering and diverging circle at the center, as depicted in the reference image. Through thorough research, I successfully overcame this challenge by implementing advanced JavaScript methods and leveraging CSS animation techniques.

The fifth section of the website, Talk to Hope, was smooth to develop, and I did not encounter any major challenges during the process.
